=== Grails Goodies for Spring MVC Demo - Spring PetClinic Sample Application 
==========================================================================

@author Jeff Tsay

This is an adaptation of the Spring PetClinic Sample Application (at 
https://src.springframework.org/svn/spring-samples/petclinic/trunk/) to enhance 
it with Grails Goodies.

First, I made the sample run in Tomcat by following these instructions:

Then I added Grails Goodies (https://github.com/jtsay362/spring-mvc-grails-goodies)
and used it to add more pages with routing defined as in Grails, and defined 
beans via the Grails BeanBuilder syntax.
